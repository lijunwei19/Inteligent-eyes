# EC602 Inteligent-home-robot
## Product Mission
Our project can control many household appliances. It can improve the quality of people's life and it can let people living more convient and automatic. Also, it can save time for users.

## Target User(s)
- Families.
- People who are very busy.

## User Stories
Users, could speech to the robot to open household appliances. It means, users can give some commands to it, such as turn on the lights. Then, it will execute the command. Our project is really like google home mini. However, the project our design is offline. Our project can protect usersâ€™ private information. This is a kind of security for your personal information. Also, our project has three functions. 

Face tracking is ensure that when users talk with the robot, it can always face to users.

Face recognition is like switch. The program will turn on when the robot recognize the face who it had known. 
- Voice control: 
- Face tracking 
- Face recognition


## MVP
A robot that can be controled by voice and has face tracking function.

##  Minimum Viable Product(MVP)
The minimum viable product is a robotic 



##  Product Survey
  1.   GOOGLE HOME MINI 
  2.   AMAZON ECHO
  
They are the kind of device which are controled by human voice. They can understand what human language. they are a kind of assistants.
## Advantage 
  - our project could analysis human vocie without internet.
  - Personal data security 
  - Face recognization and face tracking 
  - voice control bulb or household application 
##  Disadvantage 
  Not so accuracy compared with other API computer vision analysis
  
  
## System Design
  - Hardware: raspberry Pi 3 B module, camera, microphone, small monitor, sevor motor, speaker;
  - softeware: opencv library, face recognization library, Jasper; 
  - (asper is an open source platform for developing always-on, voice-controlled applications)
  -  Reason: For hardware, I also consider Arduino, but Arduino is not good at vision analysis. Raspberry is a small computer. that is more powerful. For softeware, there are so many ways to do voice analysis and visison analysis, but I think personal data is really privat especialiy for home information.
